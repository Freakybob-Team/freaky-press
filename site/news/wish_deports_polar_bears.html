<h1>Candidate Wish adds a campaign promise; and it is strange!</h1>
<hr>
<p>Freakylection candidate Wish has recently announced a new campaign promise of hers: deporting polar bears!
    Following the "go woke, go up" strategy, she has decided to rip a page out of fellow candidate Names' book, and deport the polar bears!
    This promise has not gained much attention, so we at the Freakybob Press aren't aware of any opinions.
